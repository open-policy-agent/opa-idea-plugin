# Comment / Uncomment code
Rego supports only one type of comment: `line comment`. This action is bound to native Intellij shortcut for code commenting.  
You change this shortcut in `Settings` -> `keypmap` -> `Comment with Line Comment`

*note: block comment is not supported, so if you try to perform it on a `rego` file, nothing will happen* .
