# Requirements
To build the project, you will need the following requirement

* jdk 1.8
* Opa binary (must be in the path)
* IntelliJ (community or ultimate version)

It's optional but we recommend you to install the following intelliJ plugin:
* [Grammar-Kit](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6606-grammar-kit) to get highlighting of the grammar file.
* [PsiViewer](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227-psiviewer) to view the AST of Rust files right in the IDE.

# Setup 
Just clone the project and execute the tests to ensure everything is ok.

```bash
# clone the project 
$ git clone git@github.com:vgramer/opa-idea-plugin.git
$ cd opa-idea-plugin

# run tests
$ ./gradlew  test

# Run a Sandbox ide to test plugin
 You can use the gradle task `runIde` to run an IntelliJ sandbox with
 * opa plugin installed
 * psi viewer installed
 
One the sandbox ide has started, you will have to create or open an existing project to test the plugin.  
Sometime you may need to reset your sandbox, you can use the task `clean` to do it.

# Build the plugin archive
Run the task `buildPlugin`, the `jar` will be generated in `build/libs/opa-idea-plugin-<version>.jar`


# Other important tasks
The `lexer` and `parser` code which are generated by tools are not committed in `git`. They can respectively be 
generated by the tasks `generateRegoLexer` and `generateRegoParser`. 

These tasks are linked to the `KotlinCompile` task so if you try to build, test or run the sandbox ide, the lexer and 
parser will be automatically generated.

The code is generated in the [gen folder](../../src/main/gen). If you want to reset the generated, just delete the
content of the gen folder and launch tasks `generateRegoLexer` and `generateRegoParser`.
