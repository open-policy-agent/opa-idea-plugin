# Introduction 
The project is code in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) because handle `NullPointerException` is a nightmare. Moreover,
Kotlin brings lots of cool features. If you are a `Java` developer learning curve is really smooth. [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.org/) 
has published a really good [MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/kotlin-for-java-developers)

You can setup your environment by following this [guide](docs/devel/setup_development_env.md). 
To learn more about the project architecture please read this [document](docs/devel/architecture.md)
