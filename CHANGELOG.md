# Release notes for v0.4.0

## Changes by Kind

### Feature

- Implement auto closing quote feature ([#69](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa-idea-plugin/pull/69), [@vgramer](https://github.com/vgramer))
- Run [intellij-plugin-verifier](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugin-verifier) to check plugin binary compatibility in github action

  1. update `org.jetbrains.intellij` Gradle plugin because the new version offers a task to run the plugin verifier. Consequently, remove the `ideaDependencyCachePath`customization which is not needed anymore.
